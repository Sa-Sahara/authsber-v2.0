# authsber-v2.0
Authsber is a web-service for flexible planning and distribution of employees'
working time. It is created for company that provides services through a network 
of branches. Clients can book services within the work schedule. 
I choose a car service as a specific implementation.

Depending on the role, users have flexible access to the functionality: 
viewing information about services, 
booking, 
planning working hours, 
changing and deleting data about the company's structure.
